So far, Linked Data principles and practices are being adopted by an increasing number of data providers, getting as result a global data space on the Web containing hundreds of LOD datasets \cite{Heath_Bizer_2011}. There are already several guidelines for generating, publishing, interlinking, and consuming Linked Data \cite{Heath_Bizer_2011}. An important task, within the generation process, is to build the vocabulary to be used for modelling the domain of the data sources, and the common recommendation is to reuse as much as possible available vocabularies \cite{Heath_Bizer_2011,hyland14}. This reuse approach speeds up the vocabulary development, and therefore, publishers will save time, efforts, and resources. 

There are research efforts, like the NeOn Methodology \cite{suarezfigueroa2012ontology}, the Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data - W3C Working Group Note \cite{hyland14}, and the work proposed by Lonsdale et al. \cite{Lonsdale2010318}. However, at the time of writing we have not found specific and detailed guidelines that describe how to reuse available vocabularies at fine granularity level,i.e., reusing specific classes and properties. Our claim is that this difficulty in how to reuse vocabularies at fine grained level is one of major barriers to the reuse of vocabularies on the Web and in consequence to deployment of Linked Data.

Moreover, the recent success of Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV\footnote{\url{http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/}}) as a central point for curated catalog of ontologies is helping to convey on best practices to publish vocabularies on the Web, as well as to help in the Data publication activity on the Web. LOV comes with many features, such as an API, a search function and a SPARQL endpoint.

In this paper we propose a set of guidelines for this task, and provide technological support by means of a plugin for \protege, which is one of the popular frameworks for developing ontologies in a variety of formats including OWL, and RDF(S). It is backed by a strong community of developers and users in many domains. One success on \protege also depends on the availability to extend the core framework adding new functionalities by means of plug-ins. In addition, we propose to explore, design and implement a plug-in of LOV in \protege for easing the development of ontologies by reusing existing vocabularies at fine grained level. The tool helps to improve the modeling and reuse of ontologies used in the LOD cloud.

%, by providing the following features in Prot{\'e}g{\'e}:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Import easily vocabularies from LOV into \protege. 
%\item Propose to the user a list of candidate vocabularies in LOV matching the term
%\item Have an updating mechanism (synchronization) to LOV catalog
%\item Check if a new vocabulary created in \protege satisfied the LOV recommendations \cite{pybernard12}
%\item Suggest to LOV a new created vocabulary within \protege.
%\end{itemize}

%This paper presents \protege, a first implementation of the LOV realized as a plugin for the ontology editor \protege.
